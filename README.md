# KeyRC Smart Lock System

Welcome to the GitHub repository of the KeyRC Smart Lock System, an innovative solution designed to enhance access control through smart technology. This system integrates a robust hardware setup with a user-friendly mobile application, coupled with cloud-based configuration and management.

## Project Overview

The KeyRC Smart Lock System is developed to offer a secure, scalable, and efficient means of managing entry access. It is ideal for residential and commercial properties, providing ease of access with enhanced security features.

### Features

- **Remote Access Control**: Manage your lock remotely using the mobile app.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Receive instant alerts for all lock activities.
- **Energy Efficient**: Optimized power management for prolonged battery life.

## Repository Structure

- `/hardware` - Contains all schematic files and PCB designs for the smart lock.
- `/software` - Source code for the ESP32-CAM, including camera control and WiFi connectivity.
- `/mobile_app` - Source files for the cross-platform mobile application built with React Native.
- `/cloud` - Backend and API services running on cloud infrastructure.


### Hardware Setup

1. Assemble the hardware according to the schematics in `/hardware`.
2. Flash the ESP32-CAM with the firmware from `/software`.

### Software Configuration

1. Install the required libraries and dependencies described in `/software`.
2. Configure network settings as per your environment.

### Mobile App Installation

1. Install the mobile app from the `/mobile_app` directory on your iOS or Android device.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to connect the app with the hardware.

## Usage

Once installed and configured, use the mobile app to manage access permissions, view entry logs. The app interface is intuitive, providing a seamless user experience.
